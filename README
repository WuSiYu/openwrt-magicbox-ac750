This repo is a patched OpenWrt current upstream source code for mactoy.com
MagicBox-ac750 mini router (16M flash version).

Compared with the offical source code, this repo applies some patches for the
MagicBox-ac750 mini router. This patch mainly adds a new device for this router
and add a patch to ath10k wireless driver for reading the ART data.

In addition, some useful software from openwrt-dist has been added to /package.
Including openwrt-chinadns, openwrt-dns-forwarder, openwrt-shadowvpn,
openwrt-redsocks2 and openwrt-dist-luci for their luci interface.

To compile the firmware, select Target System (Atheros AR7xxx/AR9xxx), and
Target Profile (Mactoy MagicBox AC750). Or you load my personal use config
file: /dot_config_personal, which the images in releases uses it.

This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution.

To build your own firmware you need a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system (case
sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin is unsupported because of the lack
of a case sensitive file system.

You need gcc, binutils, bzip2, flex, python, perl, make, find, grep, diff,
unzip, gawk, getopt, subversion, libz-dev and libc headers installed.

1. Run "./scripts/feeds update -a" to obtain all the latest package definitions
defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default

2. Run "./scripts/feeds install -a" to install symlinks for all obtained
packages into package/feeds/

3. Run "make menuconfig" to select your preferred configuration for the
toolchain, target system & firmware packages.

4. Run "make" to build your firmware. This will download all sources, build
the cross-compile toolchain and then cross-compile the Linux kernel & all
chosen applications for your target system.
